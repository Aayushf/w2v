# Word2Vec implementation.
* In keras, simple implementation.
* In numpy, implemented with negative sampling.
The OpinRank Hotel Review Dataset was used to create embeddings.
## Results:
This image shows a plot of the 2 dimension PCA of the embeddings.
These words were initially scattered randomly, and after training, they gradually formed clusters of similar words, as the image shows.
